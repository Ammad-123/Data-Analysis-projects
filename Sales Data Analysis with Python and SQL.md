Sales Data Analysis with Python and SQL

Project Overview

The Sales Data Analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into sales performance across different regions and products using data stored in a SQL database. By leveraging Python for data manipulation and SQL for querying, the project will perform various analytical tasks to help the business understand sales trends, identify top-performing products, and make data-driven decisions.

Objectives

Data Extraction and Transformation: Extract sales data from the SQL database and transform it for analysis.
Sales Performance Analysis: Analyze sales data to determine total sales, average sales, and trends over time.
Product and Region Analysis: Identify top-performing products and regions, and analyze their sales patterns.
Visualization: Create visualizations to represent sales data and findings.
Reporting: Generate reports summarizing key insights and recommendations.

Tools and Technologies

Python: Used for data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization.
SQL: Used for querying the sales database to extract relevant data.
Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Python libraries for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and reporting.
SQL Server/MySQL/PostgreSQL: SQL database for storing sales data.

Data Source

The project uses a sales database (e.g., df_orders) containing the following key columns:

region: The geographical region of the sales.
product_id: The unique identifier for products.
sales_price: The price at which products were sold.
sales_date: The date of the sale.
